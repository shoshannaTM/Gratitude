# Lazztech.Boilerplate

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new)

This repository serves as a jumping off point for rapid 3 tier web application development. It incorporates over a decade of software engineering, and extensive consulting experience, across various languages and frontend/backend web frameworks to propel project success. This boilerplate provides an established, opinionated, and proven platform to rapidly develop for many of the most common type of greenfield development efforts.

This boilerplate is architected with inspiration from, though not dogmatically following, the values spoken to in the speech [Building the Hundred-Year Web Service with htmx - Alexander Petros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc)

**Progressive Web App (PWA)**

This boilerplate is setup with PWA support out of the box. This includes an [installation prompt that works across platforms](https://github.com/khmyznikov/pwa-install) to guide the user to install the PWA as a traditional "App" on their devices. This works across all major platforms, desktop, and mobile. This project's service worker uses https://workboxjs.org. See the video below for a primer on PWAs and service workers with workbox.

[Fireship: Progressive Web Apps in 100 Seconds // Build a PWA from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsRylCQblw)

The workbox generated service worker takes from the `workbox-config.js`, this takes from a `view/assets/src-sw.js` and outputs a generated `/public/js/sw.js`.

```bash
# generate a new sw.js after any changes to src-sw.js
$ npm run generate:sw
```

- Performance: 100%
- Accessibility: 100%
- Best Practices: 100%
- SEO: 100%

**It starts off from a freshly generated NestJS project which provides the following:**

- Boiler plate application inspired by Spring and Angular
  - Module based dependency injection
  - Example controller
  - Example service
  - Example jest unit test suite
  - Example e2e integration testing
  - Linting
  - Code Formatting
  - Logging
- CLI for generating controllers, services, tests, etc: https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview
- Pre-configured npm scripts

**From there support for the following is added:**

## How to use this boilerplate

1. Download the source as a zip, paste the contents into a new repository, commit and push
2. Add any project icons to `public/assets/`
3. Replace the `public/favicon.ico`
4. Adjust the `public/manifest.json` `short_name`, `name`, `description`, and `icons`, values (See [khmyznikov/pwa-install](https://github.com/khmyznikov/pwa-install) documentation for details on other options such as app screenshots)
5. Set the `.png` icon in the `views/layout.hbs` <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="assets/lazztech_icon.png" /> element if you've added a png icon of a different name to `public/assets/`
6. Set the `APP_NAME` and `APP_ICON` variables in the `.env` file
7. Maintain your own i18n internationalization translations of `src/i18n/en/lang.json` in `src/i18n/[]`

## Updating your projects bootstrapped from this boilerplate

To update projects bootstrapped from this [Lazztech.Boilerplate](https://github.com/Lazztech/Lazztech.Boilerplate). Pull in upstream template changes as a single clean commit (without importing the template's history):

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/Lazztech/Lazztech.Boilerplate
git fetch --all
git merge --squash template/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Review staged changes, unstage anything you don't want

git commit -m "Merge remote-tracking branch 'template/main'"
```

**Deployment:**

The recommended path is to deploy to a vps of your choice via the provided `docker/Dockerfile` with something like [coolify](https://coolify.io/), with sqlite and local file storage, which are the defaults. If vertical scaling becomes a limiting factor, then you can use the s3 file storage and a tool like Litestream/LiteFS that allows for sqlite WAL (Write Ahead Logging) streaming backups and restoration via an s3 destination. If the project still then exceeds the capacity of sqlite then migrate to postgresql, but most likely YAGNI (You Aint Gonna Need It). For more about sqlite in production check out this talk [DjangoCon Europe 2023 | Use SQLite in production](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE).

Refer to details on configuring which database type and file storage type are below in the **Configuration** section.

Use a strong cryptographically random value for the `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.

Also Be sure to generate a new set of `PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY` and `PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY` configuration values for secure web-push functionality.

```bash
# generate public and private vapid keys
$ npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

## Development Dependencies

Development tools:

- Docker
- Node version manager
  - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
  - Automatic NVM usage: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#deeper-shell-integration

```bash
# use nvm to install node from the .nvmrc file
$ nvm install
# set the in use node version from the .nvmrc file's verision
$ nvm use
# install node dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Docker

```bash
# Build and tag docker container
$ docker build --no-cache -f docker/Dockerfile . -t lazztech-boilerplate:latest

# Cross-compile build to a given target deployment platform
# Useful for building on ARM CPU development machines or for compiling for ARM on x86
$ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --no-cache -f docker/Dockerfile . -t lazztech-boilerplate:latest

# Run the docker container from the built image
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 lazztech-boilerplate
```

## Postgres

A local instance of postgres running in a docker container for testing against a prod DB replica.
Pgadmin is not required, but recommend for ease of use. Alternatively the database-client VSCode extension may be used.

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-database-client2

Create database dump and import to local database

```bash
# prepare gitignored data folder if it's not already present
$ mkdir ./data

# dump database
$ pg_dump -h <host> -p <port> -U <username> -Fc <database> > ./data/db.dump

# start postgres
$ docker run --name lazztech_postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Password123 -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres

# copy dump file to the docker container
$ docker cp ./data/db.dump lazztech_postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data/db.dump

# shell into container
$ docker exec -it lazztech_postgres bash

# restore it from within
$ pg_restore -U postgres -d postgres --no-owner -1 /var/lib/postgresql/data/db.dump

# cleanup
$ docker stop lazztech_postgres
$ docker rm lazztech_postgres
```

In your .env or .env.local file configure these enviroment varaibles for postgres

```bash
# Postgres
DATABASE_TYPE=postgres
DATABASE_SCHEMA=postgres
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASS=Password123
DATABASE_SSL=false
```

```yml

## Lazztech LLC Cooperative Business Agreement

Each project contributor (“Contributor”) shall act as an independent contractor to Lazztech LLC (“Company”) and not as an employee, partner, or agent. Contributors are solely responsible for their own taxes, insurance, and legal compliance related to income earned through the Company. Payments shall be made to each eligible **Active Contributor** through a payment processor capable of issuing 1099 tax forms.

An **Active Contributor** is defined as any individual who has made at least one material contribution such as a code commit, pull request, documentation update, or other substantive input to a project that has been **approved by a current Active Contributor** and merged within the previous ninety (90) calendar days, measured from the date of their **last substantive contribution**.

Inactive or prospective contributors may regain/gain active status at any time by making a new contribution, reviewed and **approved by a majority of current Active Contributors**. Determinations of contributor activity and contribution history shall be verified through the project’s version control system or other mutually agreed-upon record keeping method.

Projects shall be licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3) to account for base code contribution agreement and a mutually assured open source commercial licensure, activated upon state changes and network use as a form of distribution, defined by the AGPLv3 license. Though additionally the source code of this project may be kept private or made public as determined by unanimous agreement of the project’s **Active Contributors**.

From there, 10% of each project’s revenue shall be allocated to Lazztech LLC. In exchange, Lazztech will provide this business agreement, and this boilerplate, along with hosting and deployment of resulting projects, up to a given fixed cost amount of $50 a month. The remaining 90% of a given project’s revenue shall be used to cover any additional hosting or project business expenses, as agreed upon by the projects **Active Contributors**, then split evenly to each Active Contributor of said project. This is **to ensure fairness of equity, alignment of incentive structure**, and to motivate for a cooperative lean contributor base, acting together in the best interests of a given projects **Active Contributors**.

If the project continues to generate revenue without requiring further maintenance, updates, or development, the **Active Contributors** may elect to pause the ninety-day count-down toward inactive status. This shall be documented in the docs/PROJECT_LOG.md, reviewed and approved unanimously by all **Active Contributors**. In this circumstance, contributors who made substantive contributions prior to that time shall **continue to receive their proportional share of revenue** in accordance with this agreement. This shall continue until the first unanimously reviewed, approved, and merged contribution. In which case the 90 day count-down will reset and resume for all **Active Contributors**.
